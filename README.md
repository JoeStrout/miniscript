# MiniScript

This project contains the source code of both C# and C++ implementations of the [MiniScript scripting language](http://miniscript.org).



## Sponsor Me!

MiniScript is free, and apart from a small amount of revenue from the [books](https://miniscript.org/books/) and [Unity asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/miniscript-87926), generates no significant income.  Your support is greatly appreciated, and will be used to fund community growth & reward programs like [these](https://miniscript.org/earn.html).

So, [click here to sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/JoeStrout) -- contributions of any size are greatly appreciated!
